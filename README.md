# üöó End-to-End Car Services Analysis  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project is an **end-to-end data analysis pipeline** focused on the automotive services domain (car sales, insurance, and service history). The goal was to integrate multiple datasets, clean and transform them, perform in-depth SQL-based analysis, and finally build interactive visualizations in Power BI.  

## üìä Data Sources  
The dataset was originally downloaded from **Kaggle** and cleaned using **Excel** to handle missing, null, and blank values before importing into SQL.  

### Tables Used  
1. **car_data** ‚Üí Car specifications and pricing details  
   - *(Car_ID, Brand, Model, Year, Fuel_Type, Transmission, Color, Owner_Type, Mileage_kmpl, Price_Lakh)*  

2. **insurance_data** ‚Üí Insurance details and policy status  
   - *(Car_ID, Provider, Policy_Number, Expiry_Date, Status)*  

3. **owner_data** ‚Üí Owner information and purchase year  
   - *(Car_ID, Owner_Name, Contact, City, Purchase_Year)*  

4. **sales_data** ‚Üí Sales transaction details  
   - *(Car_ID, Sale_Price_Lakh, Sale_Date, Buyer_Name)*  

5. **service_history** ‚Üí Car servicing history and costs  
   - *(Car_ID, Service_Type, Service_Date, Service_Cost, Service_Center)*  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies  
- **Excel** ‚Üí Data Cleaning  
- **SQL Server** ‚Üí Database & Analysis  
- **Power BI** ‚Üí Visualization & Reporting  

## üìù Project Steps  

### Step 1: Data Collection  
- Downloaded datasets from Kaggle.  
- Datasets include car specifications, sales, insurance, owners, and service history.  

### Step 2: Data Cleaning (Excel)  
- Removed duplicates, null, and blank values.  
- Standardized date formats and categorical fields.  
- Ensured data consistency across all tables.  

### Step 3: Database Integration & Data Analysis (SQL Server)

| Relationship between Car Mileage & Price | `Mileage_kmpl`, `Price_Lakh` |
| Total Service Cost per Year | `Service_Date`, `Service_Cost` |
| Total Service Cost per Service Type | `Service_Type`, `Service_Cost` |
| Total Cars by Owner Type | `Owner_Type` |
| Top 10 Buyers by Number of Purchases | `Buyer_Name`, `Car_ID` |
| Trend of Car Sales by Fuel Type Over Years | `Sale_Date`, `Fuel_Type`, `Sale_Price_Lakh` |
